Poker Message-Notification System

This project provides a simple WebSocket based notification system. It ist required, to run the LAMP based application
komplexitaeter/poker. It will be run standalone on PHP-CLI and will be accessed from clientside under same protocol,
host and port as the LAMP resources. So additional configuration on webserver/proxy level ist needed, to forward ws/wss
calls to this server. Here is a simple example on nginx (to be modified based on your local system setup):

 ```
server {

    server_name localhost;
    listen 80;
    root /var/www/html/;
    index index.php;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php-fpm.sock;
    }

    location /poker-msg {
        # Forward WS connections to the WS server
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8443;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_read_timeout 86400;
    }
}
 ```

To install this project on your server you might follow this example (Linux ubuntu). It is recommended, to have the following
packages up and running: php, composer, supervisor, git. Also refer to http://socketo.me/docs pls. Use e.g. apt-get to install them and follow this steps:

 ```
 mkdir /home/poker/msg #create document root e.g.
 mkdir /home/poker/logs #to place some logfiles later
 git clone -b master https://github.com/komplexitaeter/poker-msg /home/poker/msg #get sources from git
 cd /home/poker/msg
 composer install #download and build the required dependencies
 sudo touch /etc/supervisor/conf.d/poker-msg.conf
 sudo vi /etc/supervisor/conf.d/poker-msg.conf #example below
 sudo systemctl restart supervisor 
 sudo systemctl enable supervisor #might be done already
 ```

Here is an example supervisor config:
 ```
 [program:poker-msg]
command                 = bash -c "ulimit -n 10000; exec /usr/bin/php /home/poker/msg/bin/msg-server.php"
process_name            = poker-msg
numprocs                = 1
autostart               = true
autorestart             = true
user                    = root
stdout_logfile          = /home/poker/logs/poker-msg_info.log
stdout_logfile_maxbytes = 1MB
stderr_logfile          = /home/poker/logs/poker-msg_error.log
stderr_logfile_maxbytes = 1MB
 ```
